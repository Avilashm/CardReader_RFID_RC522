# CardReader_RFID_RC522
Library and example for TI MSP430 LaunchPads and Energia that reads a card number using a RC522 MIFARE module, takes action depending on the card number, and prints it to the serial monitor.

Ideas for further development:
1) Add the ability to write data - e.g. last time card was read from RTC
2) Try hooking this up to the garage door opener from outside the house
